# Capstone Project ‚Äì Machine Learning & AI

This repository contains the capstone project for the **Imperial College Professional Certificate in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence**.  
The project is designed to demonstrate end-to-end application of ML/AI techniques, from data exploration through to model development, evaluation, and deployment.

## Project Overview

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Problem statement to be defined*  
This section will later describe the specific dataset, business problem, or research question addressed in the project.

The goal of the capstone is to:
- Apply machine learning and AI techniques learned throughout the programme  
- Work with real or simulated datasets  
- Showcase model building, optimisation, and evaluation  
- Document methodology and results clearly for sharing with peers and potential employers  

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (core language)  
- NumPy, pandas (data manipulation)  
- scikit-learn, PyTorch (machine learning and deep learning)  
- Jupyter Notebook (experimentation and reporting)  
- Git/GitHub (version control and collaboration)  

## Workflow

1. Define the problem and success criteria  
2. Collect and prepare data  
3. Explore and visualise data  
4. Build baseline models  
5. Refine with advanced techniques (optimisation, regularisation, deep learning, etc.)  
6. Evaluate using appropriate metrics  
7. Summarise findings in a final report  

## Next Steps

- Finalise project problem statement  
- Identify dataset(s)  
- Begin exploratory data analysis
